Enterprise-Grade End-to-End CI/CD Pipeline with DevSecOps
_________________________________________________________________
A web-based visual tool that simulates and demonstrates the complete CI/CD pipeline process for DevOps projects. This project helps users understand how code moves from development to deployment through automated testing, building, and delivery stages.

Key Features:
________________

1.Built a Jenkins-based CI/CD pipeline using Maven. integrating SonarQube and Trivy for automated testing, code quality,             and security checks.

2,.Deployed containerized applications to Kubernetes, implementing monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana to ensure 99.9% uptime and reduce resolution time for issues by 40%.

3.DevOps Tools Used: GitHub, Jenkins, Maven, SonarQube, Trivy, Nexus, Docker, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, KubeAudit, 

Programming Languages for the web app -
_____________________________________
Frontend ->HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Back-End ->Python (Flask).

Process Flow Visualizer
A web-based application that visualizes CPU scheduling algorithms like  SJF, FCFS, Round Robin and Priority Scheduling. Users can input process details and see an interactive representation of how processes are scheduled and executed, making it easier to understand operating system concepts through real-time simulations.
